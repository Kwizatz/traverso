Known issues:

Traverso is going through a couple of development phases, and releases when
certain milestone has been reached.
This means there could be areas where Traverso is still weak.

A summary of known weak areas:

- Track adding/removing works however, un/redoing this sometimes messes up the TrackView
  possibly crashing Traverso. It's advised to not un/redo a Track add/remove.
  This will be fixed in a later release.
- Moving a project dir causes Traverso to no longer find the audiosources in
  that dir, will be fixt next release.
- FLAC is supported from libsdnfile > 1.0.12, however strange problems occur 
  when playing a flac file, which seems to be a problem related with the flac
  support in libsndfile, and not having anything to do with Traverso.
  Playing wav files via libsndfile works just fine!
