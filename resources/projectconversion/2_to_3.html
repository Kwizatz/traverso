<h4 align="center">Project file conversion from version 2 -> 3</h4>
<p>
Traverso 0.40.0 - 0.41.x is able to open project files with version 2.<br />From Traverso >= 0.42.0 it needs to be at version 3.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The conversion of the Project will consist of the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the project.tpf file to use universal sample rate for position and length, as opposed to using a fixed samplerate</li>
<li>For performance reasons it was decided to start using interleaved audio files. For each <b>recorded</b> stereo file the 2 mono files will be merged into 1 stereo file.<br /><b>NOTE: This can take a long time for large files!</b></li>
</ul>
