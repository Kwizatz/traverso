<h2>First time I started Traverso but</h2>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

Indeed, there are no Menus or buttons in Traverso, well, almost no buttons!<br />
However, all the actions are only a fingertip away, read on...
<br />
<br />
Learning how to use Traverso is as you allready noticed different in respect to other programs.<br />
There isn't the "browse through menus" and "click on buttons" to explore what the program can do for you.<br />
<br />

To make you comfortable with using Traverso, you should read the following sections:<br />

<h4><a href="qrc:/theinterface.html">The Interface</a></h4>
Explains the concept of the Interface, and how you are supposed to work with Traverso.

<h4><a href="qrc:/keycommands.html">Key Commands Explained</a></h4>
Working with the concept means you have to understand the command syntax. It's really very simple, you just need to get used to it a bit.

<h4><a href="qrc:/examples.html">Usage examples</a></h4>
A number of actions explained in detail, it will give you a first drive with Traverso :-)
