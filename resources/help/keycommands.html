<h2>Key Commands explained</h2>

As you read in the Interface section, the mouse points to a graphical object, and then "some key command" has to be performed, to for example mute an AudioClip, or modify the gain of a Track.<br />
<br />
A key command is a single or combination of key presses and or releases.<br />
Oow, that sounds difficult, isn't it?<br />
But don't worry, it's not as difficult as it sounds!<br />
<br />
Read through the categories to understand what kind of "key commands" are available, how they are notated, and of course how they are performed!

<h3>Categories</h3>
Key actions are divided in the following categories:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="#skapar">Single Key Action : Press and Release</a></li>
<li><a href="#skapah">Single Key Action : Press and Hold</a></li>
<li><a href="#skapart">Single Key Action : Press and Release Twice</a></li>
<li><a href="#dkapar">Double Key Action : Press and Release</a></li>
<li><a href="#dkapah">Double Key Action : Press and Hold</a></li>
<li><a href="#dkapart">Double Key Action : Press and Release Twice</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="skapar">Single  Key Action : Press and Release</a></h4>
This action is noted as follows:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; K &gt;
</p>

This reads as: "Press and Release a Key", just like if you was typing in a letter.<br />
The capital "K" is the key you should use.<br />
For example:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; F &gt;
</p>
means press and release the "F" key.

<h4><a name="skapah">Single  Key Action : Press and Hold</a></h4>
This action is noted as follows:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [ K ]
</p>
This reads as: "Press and Hold the Key". Pretty self explanotary, in a text editor you would get autorepeat ;-)<br />
Again, the capital "K" is the letter associated with the correct key.
For example:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [ D ]
</p>
means press and hold the "D" key.<br />
<br />
Hold key's in itself don't do anything. However if a "hold key" is active, and you move the mouse, a "analogue" action can be performed like moving an AudioClip!

<h4><a name="skapart">Single  Key Action : Press and Release Twice</a></h4>
This action is noted as follows:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &lt; K &gt; &gt;
</p>
It reads as: "Press and Release the key twice". Like typing in one letter twice, rather fast<br />
For example:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &lt; G &gt; &gt;
</p>
means press and release the "G" key twice<br />

<div align=right><a href="qrc:/keycommands.html">Top</a></div>

<h4><a name="dkapar">Double  Key Action : Press and Release</a></h4>
This action is noted as follows:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; K K &gt;
</p>
This reads as: "Press and Release 2 keys at once". One of the more difficult actions.<br />
For example:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; F G &gt;
</p>
means press and release both the "F" and "G" key at the same time.<br />

<h4><a name="dkapah">Double  Key Action : Press and Hold</a></h4>
This action is noted as follows:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [ K K ]
</p>
It reads as: "Press and hold 2 keys at once". <br />
For example:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [ F G ]
</p>
means press and hold at the same time both the "F" and "G" key<br />
<br />
The same idea applies as for the "Single  Key Action : Press and Hold", however you have to press and hold 2 keys.<br />
This is a bit more difficult to do then with a Single Key Action, and is meant for more advanced usages/users ;-)

<h4><a name="dkapart">Double  Key Action : Press and Release Twice</a></h4>
This action is noted as follows:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &lt; K K &gt; &gt;
</p>
It reads as: "Press and Release the 2 keys twice". A difficult action to learn. Two keys have to be pressed and released at the same time, two times rather fast after eachother!<br />
For example:<br />
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &lt; F G &gt; &gt;
</p>
means press and release both the "F" and "G" key at the same time twice.<br />
<br />
This key command isn't used much actually, due the fact it's rather hard to perform. But this makes it an ideal candidate for destructive actions!<br />
<br />
Although most of the actions in Traverso can be undone, it still makes sense to have this one available. It doesn't make you do anything by accident which could be potentially unrecoverable.<br />
And once you get used to the concept, it appears this key command isn't that hard after all!!
