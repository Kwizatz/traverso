Optimized builds:

Traverso's build script by default detects the host cpu feature set, for optimal build
settings. This can however make your build incompatible for certain cpu's.

You can disable host cpu feature detection with:

-DDETECT_HOST_CPU_FEATURES=OFF

To enable runtime detected SSE support, add:

-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-DSSE_OPTIMIZATIONS -DARCH_X86"


To enable runtime detected cpu fpu denormals are zero support, add:

-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-DUSE_XMMINTRIN -DARCH_X86"


If your distribution has slv2 >= 0.6.1 you can compile with:

-DUSE_SYSTEM_SLV2_LIBRARY=ON

to let Traverso use the system installed one.


E.g. compiling a package for an i686 compatible Linux system with runtime detected SSE support:

cmake . -DDETECT_HOST_CPU_FEATURES=OFF -DWANT_JACK=ON -DWANT_ALSA=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_SLV2_LIBRARY=OFF \
	-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-march=i686 -DSSE_OPTIMIZATIONS -DUSE_XMMINTRIN -DARCH_X86"


Compiling for a cpu architecture that doesn't support sse:

cmake . -DDETECT_HOST_CPU_FEATURES=OFF -DWANT_JACK=ON -DWANT_ALSA=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_SLV2_LIBRARY=OFF


Adding additional compiler flags, like compiling with -msse -mfpmath=sse (in case the targetted host supports it):

cmake . -DDETECT_HOST_CPU_FEATURES=OFF -DWANT_JACK=ON -DWANT_ALSA=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_SLV2_LIBRARY=OFF \
	-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-march=i686 -msse -mfpmath=sse  -DSSE_OPTIMIZATIONS -DUSE_XMMINTRIN -DARCH_X86"
