Unpack the tarball, and change directory to traverso.

If you like to change parameters for the build process, open the file:
travers/src/base.pri
in your favorite editor, there's information on the possible options in that very file.

Run the following commands:

$ qmake traverso.pro
$ make

After compilation is finished, you can run traverso:

$ ./traverso

Have funn!


NOTE for Packagers:

The tarball as it is supplied should be suitable for creating a distribution
package without major modification. 
Traverso itself is build as a number of libraries, it's strongly adviced to 
compile those statically, which is the default.
To change compile options for all libs, edit src/base.pri

Options that should be left alone:
DEFINES += STATIC_BUILD   
build Traverso libs statically, you really shouldn't change it

#DEFINES += PORTAUDIO_SUPPORT  
PortAudio support is only to be used for Windows and Mac OS X, Traverso has 
excelent support for ALSA and Jack, so portaudio doesn't add anything for Linux
except confusion for the users...
It also depends on the 1.9 release, which is still unreleased which might introcude
unwanted side effects (you could build against another version then we did e.g.)

DEFINES that could be changed or e.g. compiler flag options, if you don't want to 
build with SSE support by default.
