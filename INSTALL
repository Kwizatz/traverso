Unpack the tarball, and change directory to traverso.

If you like to change parameters for the build process, open the file:
travers/src/base.pri
in your favorite editor, there's information on the possible options in that very file.

Run the following commands:

$ qmake traverso.pro
$ make

After compilation is finished, you can run traverso:

$ ./traverso

Have funn!
