1) cmake based compilation:

* Unpack the tarball, and change directory to traverso.
* Make sure you have all dependencies installed, and cmake
* run cmake as follows (including the dot!):
	
  $ cmake .

* If it complains a library was missing, make sure it is installed,
  remove CMakeCache.txt and go back to the previous step.
* If cmake . completed without error, you can either run:
  
  $ ccmake .
  
  to change compilation options or:
  
  $ make
  
  to start compilation.
* After compilation finished, you can run traverso with:
  
  $ bin/traverso

* Or install it systemwide (as root)
  
  $ make install

* and run traverso directly by typing:

  $ traverso



2) qmake based compilation:

* Unpack the tarball, and change directory to traverso.

* If you like to change parameters for the build process, open the file:
  traverso/src/base.pri
  in your favorite editor, there's information on the possible options in that very file.

* Run the following commands:

  $ qmake traverso.pro
  $ make

After compilation is finished, you can run traverso:

  $ ./traverso


Have fun!


NOTE for Packagers:

The tarball as it is supplied should be suitable for creating a distribution
package without major modification.
Traverso itself is build as a number of libraries, it's strongly adviced to 
compile those statically, which is the default.


QMake based compilation:

To change compile options for all libs, edit src/base.pri

Options that should be left alone:
DEFINES += STATIC_BUILD   
build Traverso libs statically, you really shouldn't change it

#DEFINES += PORTAUDIO_SUPPORT  
PortAudio support is only to be used for Windows and Mac OS X, Traverso has 
excelent support for ALSA and Jack, so portaudio doesn't add anything for Linux
except confusion for the users...
It also depends on the 1.9 release, which is still unreleased which might introcude
unwanted side effects (you could build against another version then we did e.g.)

DEFINES that could be changed or e.g. compiler flag options, if you don't want to 
build with SSE support by default.


CMake based compilation:
From Traverso >= 0.42.0 we plan to switch over to cmake based compilation.
You can change any of the compilation options like this:

cmake . -DWANT_JACK=OFF -DWANT_ALSA=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_SLV2_LIBRARY=ON
