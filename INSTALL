1) cmake based compilation:

* Unpack the tarball, and change directory to traverso-xx-xx-xx
* Make sure you have all dependencies installed, and cmake
* run cmake as follows (including the dot!):

  $ cmake .

* If it complains a library was missing, make sure it is installed,
  remove CMakeCache.txt and go back to the previous step.

* If cmake . completed without error, you can either run:

  $ ccmake .

  to change compilation options or:

  $ make

  to start compilation.

* After compilation finished, you can run traverso with:
  
  $ bin/traverso

* Or install it systemwide (as root)
  
  $ make install

* and run traverso directly by typing:

  $ traverso


Have fun!
