TOBEDONE FOR 0.40.0

* FadeView merging code messes up start of clip when fade lenght is very short (1 or even 0 pixels)

* switching to effect mode crashes with 0 tracks

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* when changing the width of fades, the cursor should remain static (as in gain)

* Audible glitch when playing over a split point in a splitted audioclip :-( :-( :-(

* libsndfile:
	How to record to files larger 4 GB
	Sector misalignment, how to handle.

Less important:
* horizontal zooming with playhead animated causes 2 paints one at start, one at real pos during play!

* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!
