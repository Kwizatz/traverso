TOBEDONE FOR 0.40.0

* Curves should have a default (first) node which is not allowed to be removed, or moved horiztonally!!!

* sometimes the project file seems to be filled from within a loop, perhaps this is due
  some action is still in the tsar event queue being processed by the rt thread, while
  at the same time, the gui thread starts the save routine, just guessing here though..

* Audible glitch when playing over a split point in a splitted audioclip :-( :-( :-(

* I got a reproducable crash when adding a new track and importing an audio
  file into it. After exiting and re-opening traverso, it works.

* libsndfile:
	How to record to files larger 4 GB
	Sector misalignment, how to handle.
