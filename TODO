TOBEDONE FOR 0.40.0

Sheet lenght temporarily reset to wrong value problem again when moving clip (undo/redo ..)

Broken chipset, needs 3 periods:
00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* when changing the width of fades, the cursor should remain static (as in gain)

* libsndfile:
	How to record to files larger 4 GB
	Sector misalignment, how to handle.

Less important:
* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!
