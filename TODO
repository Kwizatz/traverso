TOBEDONE FOR 0.4x.x

* Loading Project with 0 sheets crashes when spectrum/correlation meters are shown
* http://traverso-daw.org/forum/index.php/topic,60.msg161.html#msg161
	(random crashes on mac os x, unable to reproduce locally)
* Bandpass filter wrong inited (or something like that) it crashes
* DecodeBuffer::delete_destination: sometimes m_channels != 'real destination channel count'


Less important:

* DragClip: to next/previous snap pos is broken problem doesn't happen with copy-clip !!
	Update: SnapList checks for wrong next/prev values now, but this needs
	also to be fixed in MoveClip

// ViewPort: m_holdCursorActive is a replacement for m_holdcursor->isVisible()
// in mouseMoveEvents, which crashes when a hold action in one viewport
// ends with the mouse upon a different viewport.
// Should get a proper fix ?
// Maybe it has to do with the hold finish (release) event is propagated to the wrong viewport ?

* when a menu is open, the viewport no longer tracks mouse move events. closing the menu and NOT
  moving the mouse delegates actions to the wrong object under the mouse.

* add docs for preparing pc for realtime use! (limits.conf stuff)

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* libsndfile: * Sector misalignment, how to handle.

* files with a very large DC offset are painted wrong in rectified view ? (see yo-vega.ogg as example)

* < Z > and < Z X > centers on the viewport and layouts the tracks, causing 2 paint events!

* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!
