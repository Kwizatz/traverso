TOBEDONE FOR 0.4x.x

* http://traverso-daw.org/forum/index.php/topic,60.msg161.html#msg161
	(random crashes on mac os x, unable to reproduce locally)

* Bandpass filter wrong inited (or something like that) it crashes



Less important:
* when a menu is open, the viewport no longer tracks mouse move events. closing the menu and NOT
  moving the mouse delegates actions to the wrong object under the mouse.

* add docs for preparing pc for realtime use! (limits.conf stuff)

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* libsndfile:
	* Sector misalignment, how to handle.

* moving a clip doesn't update the Track's cliplist (does it need to be updated ?)

* files with a very large DC offset are painted wrong in rectified view ? (see yo-vega.ogg as example)

* < Z > and < Z X > centers on the viewport and layouts the tracks, causing 2 paint events!

* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!
