TOBEDONE FOR 0.40.x

* invert plugin for j_ack

* import file, peak creation starts, undo, redo (while peak creation still active) -> crash

* add docs for preparing pc for realtime use! (limits.conf stuff)

* sometimes audible glitch when playing over splitpoint..

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* when changing the width of fades, the cursor should remain static (as in gain)

* libsndfile:
	How to record to files larger 4 GB
	Sector misalignment, how to handle.

Less important:
* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!

* Bandpass filter wrong inited (or something like that) it crashes
* Don't use flacs, they crash traverso :(
