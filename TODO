TOBEDONE FOR 0.40.0

* when changing the width of fades, the cursor should remain static (as in gain)

* Curves should have a default (first) node which is not allowed to be removed, or moved horizontally!!!

* Audible glitch when playing over a split point in a splitted audioclip :-( :-( :-(

* libsndfile:
	How to record to files larger 4 GB
	Sector misalignment, how to handle.

Less important:
* horizontal zooming with playhead animated causes 2 paints one at start, one at real pos during play!
