TOBEDONE FOR 0.4x.x

* fade out < GH > is inverted

* Export Widget: manually supplied export dir isn't used for the actual export source (WriteSource) path.

* import file, peak creation starts, undo, redo (while peak creation still active) -> crash

* add docs for preparing pc for realtime use! (limits.conf stuff)

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* libsndfile:
	* How to record to files larger 4 GB
	* Sector misalignment, how to handle.
	* flac support is rather broken

Less important:
* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!

* Bandpass filter wrong inited (or something like that) it crashes
* Don't use flacs, they crash traverso :(
