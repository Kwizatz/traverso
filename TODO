TOBEDONE FOR 0.50.x

* snaplist not functional after project load. works again after a zoom
* split clip: fade in/out on new clips is broken, sometimes they do show up, sometimes they are gone
* Setting input bus for AudioTrack: update vumeter monitoring  on the newly added bus, not the configuration on the old bus
* CurveView does not seem to overlap AudioClipView, cursor changes to early to AudioClipView from CurveView when
  moving to edge of CurveView
* Track sorting logic seems fragile with the Bus Tracks added to the logic. As a result an old project did not
  account for the added Sheet Master Bus Track at the top and Move Clip moved the clip always one track upwards
  Moving tracks up/down reset the internal trackindex and solved this issue but more robust solution is needed
* Moving Track up/down moves canvas cursor to workcursor and back during jog
* Restore original behavior of main menu bar.
* Better feedback for alsa driver when using incompatible setup, this: printf("ALSA: use %d periods for %s\n", *nperiodsp, stream_name);
  doesn't read like: you should do that! what about a popup that explains driver failures in more detail?
* vertical zoom keyfact is wrong
* new sheet/track names: force unique names ??
* add switch to turn monitoring on/off
* Project::process() must be suspended when starting an export!
* child views: make them use their own snap list.
* Notify users that if they open an old project that they won't be able to properly restore that
  project in pre 0.50.x releases !
* routing from multiple buses to buses/hardware buses
* Create Special Bounce Track, via new Track Dialog which then only accepts internal subgroup buses.
  processed twice: first process: playback, if armed, processed after project master.
  if this bounce track is armed, ask: real time or faster then real time (using the export thread instead of the hardware driver thread)
* new track dialog: create jack ports bus, or use existing bus, or create new bus, choosing one of the available hardware channels
* jack in/out buses: when removed from a track, remove them from the jackdriver too, but still be able to re-add them with the set input / add output
  buttons in track manager dialog.
* create several project templates to ship by default with traverso

### NEEDS TESTING ###
- Fold Sheet/Track with Markers 
- Select clips
- Copy/move (including un/redo) selected clips

### BUGS / WISHES ###
* custom track colors
* clips with a source start offset: qwerty navigation still broken for curve nodes!!
* fade out + snap ([ F ] + < S > ) doens't work yet.
* free disk space vs recording status
* jack transport callbacks need to be managed more robust, they cause random segfaults
* [ W ] + M release move Marker with arrow key, release W: arrow keys no longer navigate.
* on zoom level change: inform clips first, let them generate new peak data (multithreaded!) only
  then signal zoom level change (speeding up painting, if it's possible ?)
* had to add a         if (m_seeking) {return 0;} in Sheet::process() to avoid a weird crash when saving the project
  after recording clips with JACK as the driver. start_seek() however stops transport, so why is sheet::process still being
  competely run? Is it, it seems to do so at least for alex with jack 0.119.0 using jack transport....
* Clips with length < read buffer size don't play!!! FIX THAT
* MoveEdge: do not jump to Mouse Cursor!
* CD Burning: abort button clicked crashed for me once, try to reproduce ?
* class name collision: wrap everything in a namespace? RFC
* importing multiple files from file browser in resources bin places all clips on same position!!!
* sync to fpu.cc to ardours latest version!
* moving a clip left which also at the same time changes the length of the Sheet causes a huge cpu load!!
* Text clips, for use as PostIt's, shares audioclips's features, except it doens't have a source :)
* Transport console: to_start end to_end don't center the playhead!
* Curve top-left node is hardly visible
* CD Burning doesn't work when traverso was started from clicking on the binary (sometimes, when no empty disk was inserted)
* Ubuntu Intrepid package does not depend on libfftw3 ?
* http://traverso-daw.org/forum/index.php/topic,93.0.html (selecting second burn device not possible)
* current zoom-cursors get messed up at times (specially after using context menu of Zoom)
* PPC build : no jack, crashes on PPC 10.5.1 (both portaudio with jack/coreaudio), which portaudio was used?
* http://forums.frugalware.org/index.php?t=msg&goto=7949&rid=0&S=fc3e4bbb15813272bc2658068081e9d7#msg_7949
* accessability: LAC discussion:  e.g. from 25.12.07, thread "Studio reverb (impulse)"
* Unable to lock memory, Traverso runs unstable due that. Detect (parse limits.conf file) first before trying to memlock ?
* xvidcap -> for creating video demos
* new Song::get_last_location() semantics might not work well e.g. in MoveClip, TimeLineView.
* Why does the User Manual say I need libflac++?
* 2tracks project, seeking to start when beyond first clip: mp3 output garbled!
* solution for project dir renamed outside of traverso: disabling write bit ?
* http://traverso-daw.org/forum/index.php/topic,77.msg264.html#msg264

* check if permissions in /etc/security/limits.conf are set, and if not, notify the user!

* Loading Project with 0 sheets crashes when spectrum/correlation meters are shown
* http://traverso-daw.org/forum/index.php/topic,60.msg161.html#msg161
	(random crashes on mac os x, unable to reproduce locally)
* Bandpass filter wrong inited (or something like that) it crashes
* DecodeBuffer::delete_destination: sometimes m_channels != 'real destination channel count'


Less important:

* DragClip: to next/previous snap pos is broken problem doesn't happen with copy-clip !!
	Update: SnapList checks for wrong next/prev values now, but this needs
	also to be fixed in MoveClip

* add docs for preparing pc for realtime use! (limits.conf stuff)

* Curve copy should not use the same id!!!!!!

* libsndfile: * Sector misalignment, how to handle.

* files with a very large DC offset are painted wrong in rectified view ? (see yo-vega.ogg as example)

* < Z > and < Z X > centers on the viewport and layouts the tracks, causing 2 paint events!

* Painting last curve nodes has artifacts, 'fixed' by populating polygon with as many points as there are
  pixels. This should get a real fix!!


Future:

* mute bounce track unmutes input buses and vice versa: special key for that ?

* make theme look awesome
* clip joining
* Add toggle: Sheet -> Mixer view and vice versa
* Sheets are Track Folder: create Project Mixer (Sheet): toggle Mixer View on/off works here too.
* Scratchpad Sheet: be able to show a track/subgroup onto this special type of Sheet.
* Mixer View == a Track (pan, gain, VU, plugins etc)
* Mixer Sheet: contains a grid (configurable amount of rows/columns) with Mixer Views, be able to browse
        and move and edit them like tracks.
  Be able to detach it, and move it to another workspace.
* Mixer Strip VU: needs to look really sexy!
* Panning is balance in T, real panning explained here: http://www.harmonycentral.com/docs/DOC-1106
* Sheets are track folders: manage solo/mute on the Project level, so solo in a sheet A mutes all non-soloed tracks in all sheets.
* Project owns a subgroup buses sheet to manage it's buses to use in a mixer sheet view to be able to route tracks from any sheet to
  global (owned by project) subgroup buses.
* Sheets are track folders toggle: one time only action to be sure you don't messup your routing, cause it might go over the project level.
* select region/multiple clips -> create new Sheet from region/clips.
