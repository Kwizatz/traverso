TOBEDONE FOR 0.40.0

* Finish remaining problems due port to QGhraphicsView (remon: working on it)
* New Theme class could be improved, at least existing code should make 
  better use of it! I (remon) will update TrackView so one can have an
  idea how it can be used, anyone else like to work on this?
  E.g. by working on the default theme, and one for people that can't see
  certain colors ??
* Information Widget, which I'd like to place below the menubar. It'll show
  the Song information, a menu to select another song, create a new song,
  and so on, anyone willing to give it a try?
* Track verticall zoom: fixed values, or analog ?
* Snapping: make it work again (remon: working on it)
	What about improving the drag audioclip command class to make use
	of the new InputEngine capabilities ? ( F key -> move to next snap pos,
	W key to previous snap pos, scroll -> .... ?) (anyone ?)
* Number Input: make it work in combination with the HoldCursor.
* Effect View: at least make it possible to 'add' the FadeCurve and Pan Curve.
	(This more or less works allready, its just how we want to visualize it)
* LV2 support: If no plugins get availble, leave it for now
* AudioClip doesn't show up after recording! (does it still ?)
* When Track::init_recording fails, traverso crashes afterwards!
* Duplicates of AudioClips don't work yet! (they share the same settings, so when modifying the seconds audioclip
	the changes get lost on saving!!)
* Get rid of using < LEFTSHIFT > to set the workcursor position, at least, create
  a new command for moving the work cursor in a similar way the playhead can be 
  positioned. Key fact I've in mind: [ W ].
  [ W ] + modifier keys (like Q and E) to set work cursor to next/previous snap position
* There must be lot's of other nice features like the one mentioned above, which are trivial to implement!
* User Manual, with at least a step by step introduction on how to get started, creating a project,
  assigning Buses to tracks, arming a track, recording, un/redo, moving audioclips, split, copy, and so on.


Other items, some of them are suggestions from Nicola:

Maybies for 0.40.0:

* Move the Settings widget from the Manager widget to the menu bar, and use a QDialog to display it.
  Divide the thing into logical catagories, there is an example of one in the demos or examples dir 
  of the qt source code!!
* Add menu entry "New Project" in the "File" menu, people expect it to be there ????

* If (imported) audiosource can't be find, don't 'remove' the audiosource and related clips, but mark as 'audiosource has gone!' 
* Add Traverso to the menu system!
* Investigate the value of a snappable grid, based on the timeline where the grid is in seconds, milliseconds etc 
* When jack is configured with only playback ports, traverso thinks they are capture buses :(
* One thing I forgot to file a bug report for: If several audio clips are selected, all actions such as dragging, 
	moving edges, gain, and (very important:) editing fades should be applied to all clips in the selection. 
	Maybe this would be a good (easy to implement?) improvement which would justify another minor release.
* (outside) processing with for example sox
* 1. Monitoring: As soon as a track is armed for recording, the channel should be 'opened', that means the audio 
	stream should be piped through the channel (including all plugins etc.), but just not recorded to disk. 
	The VU metre should be active in order to show that a signal is coming in, and to allow to set the levels 
	correctly. In most 'grown up' DAW programmes this behaviour is switchable (monitoring on/off). I don't know 
	why, but it seems to be important to be able to switch it off. Probably to avoid feedbacks when setting up 
	microphones etc., so as not to have to disarm each track.
* 1.1 Playback / Record: I think we should distinguish between playing back and recording. In playback mode all 
	tracks are played back, regardless of whether they are armed or not. In recording mode armed tracks should 
	record and disarmed tracks should play back as usual. This will allow to implement 'overdubbing' funcionality 
	with 'punch-in' and 'punch-out' markers easily. If someone is not familiar with these features, let me know and
	I will elaborate on it.
* 2. It would probably be a good thing to have a VU meter on each track. Once we have subgroups and aux busses it 
	would be easier to follow the signal path visually, and also to see how the levels evolve after going through 
	various plugins, splitting, merging etc.

	
	
For some time later:

* QGraphicsView:
	case: During HoldCommand wheel event, after HoldCommand finished, 
	key press events are duplicated (send twice that is)!
