05-07-2006 Remon Sijrier <remon@vt.shuis.tudelft.nl>
	* Released 0.30.0
	
	* Added a "select project dir" in Project manager view.
	* Correctly set AudioClip track start/end frame at startup.
	* Fixed project render progress indication for long Songs (> 16 minutes)
	* Don't load/set a newly created Project, so the SongView of the current loaded
	  project will still be accessible!
	* Fixed issues with solo-stereo AudioClips in one Track. 
	* Make pan work for solo AudioClips as well.
	* Made fadeout adjustment follow the mouse which is more natural.
	* Added "Draw Rectified Wave" radiobutton in Settings View.
	* A number of crashing fixes.
	* Some more (important) stuff I don't remember ;-)


16-06-2006 Remon Sijrier <remon@vt.shuis.tudelft.nl>
	* Released 0.30.0-rc1
	
	* Fixed a memory corruption bug which caused the computer to halt when the Jack driver
	  was running on Project export.
	* Fixed bug where audioclip edges were set at the wrong position on AudioClip split.
	* Fixed AudioClip drag, sometimes the AudioClip got duplicated in one of the Tracks.
	* Fixed solo-mute bug, sometimes the AudioClip got silenced after Track solo-mute state change,
	  where it should not.
	* Correctly calculate the Song render start and end frame.
	* Added (de)normalization for AudioClips

23-05-2006 Remon Sijrier <remon@vt.shuis.tudelft.nl>
	* Released 0.29.0
	
	All changes below are from the fork until the release of 0.29.0
	
	* Fully seperated the GUI from the core code. Core code is a library, named libtraversocore
	* Ported to Qt4, no Qt3 Support is needed.
	* The application links statically to libtraversocore, and has all resource files compiled in,
		so no install is needed (makes testing builds much more comfortable)
	* Reimplemented the audio rendering, and driver backends. 
		This means: 
		- Support for Jack, and much better support for ALSA.
		- Normalized bitdepth (32 bit float), making bitdepth transparent throughout the application.
		- Using libsndfile for audio reading/writing, resulting in much more stable audio file
			read/writes and more audio formats are supported transparently, including FLAC
		- Audio file read/writes are decoupled from the audio thread with lockless ringbuffers
			greatly improving (soft) realtime behaviour.
	* Fade In/Out improved. Fade's are Curves now, with a number of presets.
	* Removed hard coded "Keyboard Shortcuts" code, replaced with scripting functionallity provided
		by Qt. Key shortcuts are stored in an xml file now, and can be reloaded at runtime!
	* Project rendering improved due use of libsndfile. Export to a number of audio formats, including 
		samplerate conversion is possible.
	* Runtime switching to Jack/ALSA/Null driver supported, including setting a new samplerate and/or 
		latency. It's inavitable that changing the driver or driver parameters will cause a short
		sound drop in case the application is playing/recording.
	* History implemented (a.k.a. Un/Redo).
	* Contextual Menu's.
	* Drag and Drop Audiofiles into any Track, or manually Import audiofiles.
	* Audio Waveform drawing improved, 2 modes are possible, "Classic View" and "Rectified View".
	* Improved "Help" Dialog, with a short introduction on how to use the application.
	* Indication of total CPU _time_ spend in both the audio thread and hard disk I/O thread.
	* Massive code cleaning, and adoption of one coding style.
	* Better Object Oriented Design, better information encapsulation using Qt signal/slot feature.
	* More "minor" things I don't remember ;-)

	The author of the Protux/libmustux project decided to cancel my participation in the mustux project. 
	 
	I decided to fork the project, any help is of course welcome :-)
