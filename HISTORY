Traverso is a fork of the Protux project, and continued on the code base as of 10-2005.
Protux is licenced under the GPL (https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/protux/)

The Protux author decided to port the project from Qt/C++ to Java, using the Java SDK.
Contributors who contributed code to Protux can be found in the AUTHORS file.
No copyright notices were included in the Protux source files, so I decided to make 
this HISTORY file, and point you to the AUTHORS file to credit the developers who worked on Protux.
